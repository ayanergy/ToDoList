# To-do Lists using Javascript

This to-do list contains active and completed tasks containers which are connected via Javascript. The design was inspired by the [UI design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1182683143786000762) by product designer [Danny Sapio](https://www.dannysapio.com/).
## üí°Features

All the below mentioned features are elaborated on in the usage examples section.

- Task category, urgency and required effort attributes
- Sorting based on deadline (earliest first)
- Date to day conversion (and vice versa)
- Quick deletion and transfer methods


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage examples

The basic UI is shown below. It contains three columns:
- **Input column** which consists of task name, category, deadline, effort, and urgency attributes.
- **Active tasks** which is located in the center and will display all active tasks and their attributes.
- **Completed tasks** which is located on the left and will display all completed tasks and their attributes.

Here's how the different task attributes are displayed:
- The **number** inside the colored circle represents the *effort* required - one meaning minimal effort and three meaning required effort.
- The **color** of the circle denotes the *urgency* attribute. Red represents urgent, orange represents required, and green represents secondary task.
- The **deadline** attribute is converted into *day* in the Javascript file. In order to know how to convert it back to date instead, check the next section.

## üóìÔ∏è Day and date conversion

Here are the changes you need to make in order to convert from day to date and vice versa if required:

Update the Javascript *gday()* function like this
```javascript
function gday(deadline) {
  
  const weekday = ["Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat"];
  const date = new Date(deadline);
  let day = (date).toLocaleDateString();
  
  return day;
}
```

For UI aesthetic purposes, change decrease the border radius of the day/date shape from 20% to 10% in the CSS file like this
```css
.day {
    
    grid-column: 1;
    grid-row: 2;
    
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    
    margin-top: 15px;
    margin-left: 5px;
    padding: 7px;
    
    width: fit-content;
    height: 18px;
    border-radius: 10%;
    background-color: var(--accent);
    
    color: white;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    
}
```

Here's the output of the date version:
